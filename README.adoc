My own configuration files.

=== Overview
[.lead]
My collection of configuration files for many tools.
This configurations are to my setup and tooling, could
or couldn't work for you.

NOTE: Some configuration could depends on configuration
of another tool so even had the possibilitty of install single
one, it's recommended to install all configurations.

==== Installing configs

There's a script called `dotfile` in repository root
that can be used to installing configurations.

No help message yet, but the script commands are:

`install`:: install a config given a name *or* all when no argument provided.

`uninstall`:: uninstall some config *or* all when no argument provided.

`list`:: will list the installable configs and their status (WIP).

`help`:: show help message (WIP).
